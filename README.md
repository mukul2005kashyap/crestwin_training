Git-
Git is a version control system—basically a smart way to track changes in your code over time and work safely with others.
Why Git is used :-
Track code changes-
Every time you make a change, Git can save a snapshot (called a commit).
If something breaks, you can go back to a working version.

Work with teams-
Multiple people can work on the same project without overwriting each other’s code.
Git merges everyone’s work safely.

Backup your code-
If your laptop crashes, your code is still safe on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket.

Experiment without fear (branches)-
You can create a branch to try new features.
If it works → merge it
If it fails → delete it
